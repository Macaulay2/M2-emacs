		Tutorial on the use of EMACS with Macaulay 2
     	       	    	      Part 2

In this file we learn how to use emacs to edit Macaulay 2 code.  Assuming you
have set up your .emacs file as described in part 1 (see the file emacs.hlp),
you will see on the mode line of this window the name "Macaulay 2" in
parentheses, indicating that this file is being edited in Macaulay 2 mode.

To see how electric parentheses, electric semicolons, and indentation work,
move to a blank line of this file and enter the following text.

f = () -> (
     a := 4;
     b := {6,7};
     a+b)

Observe carefully how matching left parentheses are indicated briefly when a
right parenthesis is typed.  

Now position your cursor in between the 6 and 7.  Notice how
M-C-u moves you up out of the list to its left.  Do it again.  Experiment
with M-C-f and M-C-b to move forward and back over complete parenthesized
expressions.  (In the emacs manual a complete parenthesized expression is
referred to as an sexp, which is an abbreviation for S-expression.)  Try out
C-U 2 M-C-@ as a way of marking the next two complete parenthesized
expression, and see how to use C-W to kill them and C-Y to yank them back.
Experiment with M-C-K to kill the next complete parenthesized expression.

Position your cursor on the 4 and observe how M-; will start a comment for
you with two hyphens, and position the cursor at the point where commentary
may be entered.

Type

     res

somewhere and then press C-C TAB to bring up the possible completions of the
word to documented Macaulay 2 symbols.

Notice how C-H m will display the keystrokes peculiar to the mode in a help window.
